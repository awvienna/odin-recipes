    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">Originary from Asia, Sushi is believed to be created by the Japanese about 4389 years ago. (source: voices of my head)</p>
    <p class="description">This recipe will try to emulate what I've been eating when I go to all-you-can-eat japanese restaurants. Here are the ingredients:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Japanese Rice (it has to be the correct one, otherwise it won't hold together</li>
        <li>Nori (the algae that holds everything together)</li>
        <li>Assorted fish and sea crustaceous</li>
        <li>Additional ingredients for extra flavour: strawberries, cream cheese, scallions and fried onions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step by Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure that every fish and sea creature is properly clean and conditioned for raw eating. It is recommended to use rice vinegar and salt and keep the fish under the compound for at least 24hrs before consuming; safety first when the subject is raw food!</li>
        <li>Grab your nori piece and put a generous amount of japanese rice (previously rinsed, cooked and seasoned) on top of the groovy side of the nori. Press firmly and distribute evenly.</li>
        <li>Add the desired amount of fish, being mindful that the nori is soon to be rolled. In this case, it is more advantageous to put a slice of fish and the bottom of the nori and roll the algae and rice around the fish.</li>
        <li>Finally, cut it in 1" pieces and eat it with soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Share it with friends!</li>
    </ol>
