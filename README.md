# odin-recipes

This project is part of the assignent by The Odin Project that is supposed to help me develop my HTML chops. At the time I'm writing this, I understand that I'll be creating a webpage that links to other pages with recipes. At the end of this project I shall update this file to document what worked well, what didn't and what I do expect for the next steps.
